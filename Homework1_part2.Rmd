###Drawing samples from log normal distribution with given mean and sd

```{r} 

m <- 1
sd <- 0.25
mean_norm_dist <- log(m^2 / sqrt(sd^2 + m^2))
sd_norm_dist <- sqrt(log(1 + (sd^2 / m^2)))

sample_draw <- rlnorm(n=100, mean_norm_dist, sd_norm_dist)
print(mean_norm_dist)
print(sd_norm_dist)
```

###Plotting histogram of distribution

```{r}

hist(sample_draw,
     main = "Histogram of Samples")
```

###Plotting histogram of of log transformed distribution

```{r}

hist(log(sample_draw),
     main = "Histogram of log transformed samples")
